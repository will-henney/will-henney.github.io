        <description>I have decided to start writing a technical blog, hosted on github pages. It will be focussed on python, emacs, and astrophysics.
This all started in a roundabout way after I was looking into bi-directional import/export between Things 3 and Emacs org-mode. That led me to looking at Karl Voit&amp;rsquo;s orgformat python library, which in turn led to his lazyblorg blogging environment for org-mode. I had always meant to try and start a blog, making use of all the reams of material that I write in my org-mode notes, but had never got round to it.</description>
